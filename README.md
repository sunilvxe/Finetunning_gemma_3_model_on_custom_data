# Gemma 3 Fine-Tuning on Medical Dataset 🚀💉

Welcome to the repository for fine-tuning the **Gemma 3** model (4B parameters) on a custom **Medical Dataset**. This project provides a complete guide, including code, experiments, and evaluation metrics, to help you adapt a state-of-the-art language model to the medical domain. 🧠📊

---

## Overview 🔍

The **Gemma 3** model is a powerful language model designed for various natural language processing tasks. In this repository, you will find:
- A **Jupyter Notebook** (`Finetunning_Gemma3_(4B)_on_Medical_Dataset.ipynb`) demonstrating the fine-tuning process.
- Detailed steps to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
- Visualization of results to track training progress and model improvements.

---

## Features ✨

- **Fine-Tuning Process:** Step-by-step instructions to adapt Gemma 3 to your dataset.
- **Custom Medical Dataset:** Specialized data for medical domain insights.
- **Visualization Tools:** Graphs and charts to monitor training and validation metrics.
- **Reproducibility:** Clear setup and usage instructions to help others replicate the experiments.
- **Scalability:** Easily adjust the training parameters for different datasets or model sizes.

## Best Practices & Tips 📝

- **Environment Variables:** Store sensitive credentials (e.g., API keys) as environment variables instead of hardcoding them. 🔒
- **Data Backup:** Regularly backup your dataset and model checkpoints. 💾
- **Experiment Tracking:** Use tools like [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/) or TensorBoard to log and compare experiments. 📈
